# Pokedex React

# Application currently in development

- The visual aspect of the aplication is mostly complete.
- Most of the functionalities still need to be developed.
- As well as the integration with the Pokedex API, that problably will be made using GraphQL with Apollo.

An initial "preview" build of the application is available through vercel: https://pokedex-react-ojxpqaljn-assiscs2.vercel.app/

The project uses Typescript, React, Vite, Tailwind, and soon Apollo for the API integration.
